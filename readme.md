# Ideal Gas Law command-line

<img src="doc/img/idealgas.jpg" />

This is a command-line tool that can calculate the ideal gas formula, including various forms such as PV=nRT (where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature), PV = MwRT (where M is mass and w is molecular weight), PMw = DRT (where D is density), and P = MRT (for a unit volume of gas). These equations allow users to determine various gas properties under different conditions.
